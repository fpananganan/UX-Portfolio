            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> A position in travel nursing can be a very lucrative and rewarding career. A travel nurse is typically contracted to work at a specific location for a limited amount of time. </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> These contracts, otherwise known as assignments, usually last for 13-week periods and can often extend out to 52-week assignments, depending on the client's need. </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> Travel Resource Network aims to change that. The idea is a unified mobile application that only sources travel assignments for these clinicians. </p>

            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> For the first step in this discovery phase, I needed to gather more information regarding my target audience, so I began with creating and distributing user surveys.

            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> With a former background in nurse recruitment services, I was able to leverage my contacts in this community who were more than willing to take my survey and pass it along to their colleagues. </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> At the conclusion of the survey, I tallied a total of 23 responses which were analyzed with the following results being documented: </p>
            <ul class="pl-3 mb-5 mt-2 text-left text-secondary">
              <li class="mb-2 text-left text-secondary"> 100% of the respondents used mobile applications to source information for professional and personal use daily </li>
              <li class="mb-2 text-left text-secondary"> A little over half (52.2%) of the respondents used their mobile devices as an outlet to source their next travel assignment </li>
              <li class="mb-2 text-left text-secondary"> Indeed, LinkedIn and Craigslist were the three top job sites used when looking for new travel assignments </li>
              <li class="mb-2 text-left text-secondary"> All respondents (100%) collectively agreed that if a new application were to be introduced to the market whereby the product was solely intended for travel nurses, they would be interested in using the product. </li>

            <h6 class="text-left text-secondary"> How can Travel RN be different in the market? </h6>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> Although Travel Resource Network was being created for a niche group of users, I still needed to figure out how to differentiate the product from other popular competitors who already had a large footprint in the job search industry. </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> Among the information collected in my user surveys, I uncovered three main job sites that travel nurses were already using - Indeed, LinkedIn and (surprisingly) Craigslist. It was these three sites that seemed to be the top choices. Indeed proved to be the most popular based mainly off its global branding and recognition. </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> LinkedIn ran second place with its main benefit of a networking platform similar to the likes of a social network but with more of a professional appearance. Craigslist was an interesting option. Not aesthetically pleasing to the eye, the user interface was familiar to existing users who already used Craigslist for its other services. </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> Drawing from my years of experience in sales / business development and marketing, I got to work in crafting an MVP that borrowed certain strengths from each of the competitors. What if Travel Resource Network had a platform that had a clean interface like Indeed, and easy to remember features (minus the additional noise) like Craigslist - but with a user-centered focus strictly on travel nurses. </p>

            <h6 class="text-left text-secondary"> Conceptual Ideation </h6>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> Given the information I had collected thus far, I was able to begin putting some branding ideas to paper. I wanted to stay focused and accountable to my users, so the concepts had to resonate and represent the first phase of consistency in this case - the first impression is the lasting impression. </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> Some of my inital concepts of branding names were: </p>
            <ul class="pl-3 mb-3 mt-2 text-left text-secondary">
              <li class="mb-2 text-left text-secondary"> Nurse Travel </li>
              <li class="mb-2 text-left text-secondary"> Flight Nurse </li>
              <li class="mb-2 text-left text-secondary"> Go RN </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> I had some other concepts as well, but those three stood out as strong possibilities. However, given that the overall goal was to connect travel nurses to assignments, including all pertinent information related to the assignment, I eventually came up with and selected <strong> Travel <span class="text-danger"> RN </span> </strong> - with the <span class="text-danger"> <strong> R </strong> </span> & <span class="text-danger"> <strong> N </strong> </span> standing for <strong> resource network </strong> </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> The brand as a product needed to capture the thought processes of travel nurses who sourced contract assignments all over the country. Travel RN would create a platform of connectivity among these nurses, as well as potential employers, providing a smooth transition of information readily available regarding each assignment. </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> In addition, displaying all information regarding each assignment with location and activities playing an important role - the product had to display something fun or eye catching about the area. After all, it isn't always about work when traveling. </p>

            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> After the completion of the tests, it was concluded that a home page should illustrate places of potential assignments rather than having the user land directly in their profile page after signing up as a new user or logging in as a returning user.

            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> What Have I Learned? </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> Travel RN is a personal project that I became very passionate about. Given my former experience in healthcare and background in the travel nursing sector, the project slowly began taking a form of its own -- from ideation to production of the MVP. </p>
            <p class="text-left text-secondary"> Looking forward to further enhancements and development of the product, I'd like to find out if other traveling healthcare professionals (i.e. therapists and medical coders) would benefit from such an application. From a marketing perspective, this would greatly enhance the product's image and branding in popularity with hopes of establishing a footprint within the healthcare industry as a viable resource where travel opportunities are concerned. In a business sense, the next challenge would then have to be identifying a possible way for the product to begin revenue. </p>
